created a account on droplet 
set up a virtual machine running linux ubuntu used a pre made instance that already had docker installed 
setup docker, funny enough still had to sudo snap install docker, lol
installed wireguard created a private and public key 
I was able to use winspc to log into the virtual machine and pull out the config file onto my computer 
used this file to set up wireguard on my pc was aple to activate and get wire guard tunnel working 
after this I got wireguard installed on my phone 
was able to use this command: docker-compose logs -f wireguard to make wireguard give me a qr code 
I was able to use the wireguard app to scan the qr code and get that activated on my phone
